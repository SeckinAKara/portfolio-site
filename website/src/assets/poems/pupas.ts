/*
queers aren't born
we're revealed
with old eyes and deep chests
enclosing each otherâ€™s wispy gasps
you meet one, you've met none
we're all different tomorrow, today
i see futures in your eyes
you'll wreck the whole damn world
just climbing your own mountains
spinning like polyhedra
lichenic
archaea
we'll live forever in half-wrote texts
queers never die
we just return
